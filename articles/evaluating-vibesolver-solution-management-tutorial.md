  // Text search with debouncing
  if (searchQuery.trim()) {
    filtered = filtered.filter(solution =>
      solution.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
      solution.description.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
      (solution.tags && JSON.parse(solution.tags).some((tag: string) => 
        tag.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())
      ))
    );
  }
  
  // Multi-criteria filtering
  if (filter.tags?.length > 0) {
    filtered = filtered.filter(solution => {
      const solutionTags = solution.tags ? JSON.parse(solution.tags) : [];
      return filter.tags!.some(tag => solutionTags.includes(tag));
    });
  }
  
  // Optimized sorting with memoization
  filtered.sort((a, b) => {
    // Dynamic sorting implementation
  });
  
  setFilteredSolutions(filtered);
