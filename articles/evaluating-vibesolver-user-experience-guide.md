export function RequirementsForm({ onSolutionGenerated }: Props) {
  // ✅ Custom hooks for clean separation of concerns
  const generateSolution = useGenerateAWSSolution();
  const saveSolution = useSaveSolution();
  const toast = useToast();
  
  // ✅ Type-safe form handling with validation
  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    // Input validation with user feedback
    if (requirements.trim().length < 20) {
      toast.error('Please provide more detailed requirements');
      return;
    }
    
    // ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback
    try {
      const solution = await generateSolution.mutateAsync(requirements);
      await saveSolution.mutateAsync({ solution, requirements });
      toast.success('AWS solution generated successfully!');
    } catch (error) {
      toast.error('Failed to generate solution. Please try again.');
    }
  };
}
```

**AI Integration Pattern:**
```typescript
// Structured AI output with Zod validation
export const awsSolutionSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string(),
  description: z.string(),
  awsServices: z.array(z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    purpose: z.string(),
    configuration: z.string(),
  })),
  architecture: z.object({
    components: z.array(/* ... */),
    connections: z.array(/* ... */),
  }),
  costEstimate: z.number(),
  recommendations: z.array(z.string()),
});

// ✅ Type-safe AI function with error handling
export async function generateAWSSolution(requirements: string) {
  const result = await generateObject({
    model: anthropic('claude-3-sonnet-20241022'),
    schema: awsSolutionSchema,
    prompt: `As an AWS Solutions Architect...`,
