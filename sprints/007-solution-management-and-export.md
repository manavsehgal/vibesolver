# Sprint 007: Solution Management and Export Capabilities

## Overview

This sprint transforms VibeSolver from a single-session tool into a comprehensive solution management platform. Users will be able to save, organize, export, and share their AWS solutions across multiple sessions and projects. The sprint implements persistent solution storage, professional export formats, and collaboration features that enable users to build a library of reusable architectures and share insights with their teams. This enhancement positions VibeSolver as a complete AWS solution development and documentation platform.

## Goals

- **Implement Persistent Solution Storage** - Save solutions to local database with metadata, tags, and version history

### 7. Solution Version Control and History

**Test Example**: Users can view solution evolution, restore previous versions, and track architectural changes

- Implement comprehensive version history with timestamps and change descriptions
- Create visual diff views showing changes between solution versions
- Add version branching for exploring alternative architectural approaches
- Implement solution restore functionality to revert to previous versions
- Create change logs with automatic generation of modification summaries

- Implement solution merging for combining different architectural approaches

### 8. Advanced Search and Discovery

**Test Example**: Complex queries find relevant solutions across large collections using multiple criteria

- Implement advanced search with Boolean operators and field-specific queries
- Add semantic search capabilities for finding solutions by architecture patterns
- Create auto-suggestion and search completion for faster discovery
- Implement related solution recommendations based on AWS services and patterns
- Add search filters for technical criteria (performance, cost, security level)
- Create saved searches and search alerts for monitoring new solutions
- Implement solution analytics showing usage patterns and popular architectures

### 9. Solution Organization and Workspace Management

**Test Example**: Users can organize solutions into projects, workspaces, and categories with intuitive navigation

- Create hierarchical organization with projects, workspaces, and solution categories
- Implement drag-and-drop organization and bulk solution movement
- Add workspace templates for different types of projects and use cases
- Create solution dependencies and relationship mapping
