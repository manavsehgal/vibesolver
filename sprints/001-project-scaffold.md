# Sprint 001: Project Scaffold

## Overview

This inaugural sprint establishes the foundational technical infrastructure for VibeSolver, an AI twin of an AWS Solutions Architect. The sprint focuses on setting up a complete development environment with the recommended vibe-coding friendly stack optimized for Claude 4 code generation. We'll create a robust, type-safe, and testable foundation that supports the product vision of natural language AWS solution generation with visual workflows and architecture diagrams.

## Goals

- **Scaffold Complete Project Structure** - Implement the full React 18 + TypeScript + Vite application with proper folder organization
- **Configure Development Toolchain** - Set up testing, linting, formatting, and build tools for optimal developer experience
- **Establish Data Layer Foundation** - Configure SQLite with Drizzle ORM for local-first data storage
- **Integrate AI Capabilities** - Set up Vercel AI SDK with Anthropic integration for natural language processing
- **Enable PWA Functionality** - Configure Workbox for offline-first capabilities and local deployment

## Tasks

### 1. Core Project Setup

**Test Example**: `npm run dev` starts development server on http://localhost:5173

- Initialize Vite React TypeScript project structure
- Configure package.json with proper scripts and dependencies
- Set up pnpm workspace configuration
- Create proper .gitignore for Node.js/React project

### 2. Dependencies Installation & Configuration

**Test Example**: `npm run build` successfully compiles TypeScript without errors

- Install core dependencies: React 18+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Install data layer: better-sqlite3, drizzle-orm, drizzle-kit
- Install state management: zustand, @tanstack/react-query
- Install AI integration: ai, @ai-sdk/anthropic
- Install PWA support: vite-plugin-pwa, workbox-window
- Install development tools: vitest, react-testing-library, eslint, prettier

### 3. TypeScript & Build Configuration

**Test Example**: TypeScript compilation passes with strict mode enabled

- Configure strict TypeScript settings in tsconfig.json
- Set up Vite configuration with proper plugins and optimizations
- Configure path aliases for clean imports (@/components, @/lib, etc.)
- Set up environment variable handling for development/production

### 4. Styling & UI Foundation

**Test Example**: Tailwind utilities render correctly in browser

- Initialize and configure Tailwind CSS with PostCSS
- Set up CSS reset and base styles
- Create design system foundation (colors, typography, spacing)
- Configure Tailwind for dark/light mode support

### 5. Database & ORM Setup

**Test Example**: Database connection established and schema can be pushed

- Configure SQLite database file structure
- Set up Drizzle ORM configuration and scripts
- Create initial database schema files
- Implement database migration system
- Add database seeding capabilities

### 6. State Management Architecture

**Test Example**: Zustand store updates trigger React re-renders

- Set up Zustand store structure for global state
- Configure TanStack Query for server state management
- Create state management patterns and utilities
- Implement proper TypeScript types for store states

### 7. AI Integration Foundation

**Test Example**: AI SDK successfully connects to Anthropic API

- Configure Vercel AI SDK with Anthropic provider
- Set up environment variables for API keys
- Create AI service abstraction layer
- Implement error handling for AI API calls

### 8. Testing Infrastructure

**Test Example**: `npm run test` executes all tests successfully

- Configure Vitest for unit and integration testing
- Set up React Testing Library for component testing
- Create test utilities and helpers
- Implement testing patterns for stores and hooks
- Add test coverage reporting

### 9. Development Tools & Quality Assurance

**Test Example**: `npm run lint` and `npm run format` execute without errors

- Configure ESLint with TypeScript and React rules
- Set up Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Create pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Set up VS Code workspace configuration

### 10. PWA Configuration

**Test Example**: Application installs as PWA and works offline

- Configure Vite PWA plugin with service worker
- Set up app manifest.json with proper icons and metadata
- Implement offline caching strategies
- Add PWA installation prompts

### 11. Project Structure & Documentation

**Test Example**: All import paths resolve correctly and documentation is accessible

- Create organized folder structure (/src/components, /src/lib, /src/hooks, etc.)
- Set up barrel exports for clean imports
- Create CLAUDE.md with code generation guidelines
- Document development workflow and commands

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `pnpm install` successfully installs all dependencies
- [ ] `pnpm dev` starts development server with hot reload
- [ ] `pnpm build` creates optimized production bundle
- [ ] `pnpm test` runs all tests with coverage reporting
- [ ] `pnpm lint` passes without errors
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds with strict mode
- [ ] Tailwind CSS utilities render correctly
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully
- [ ] AI SDK connects to Anthropic API (with valid API key)
- [ ] Application installs and functions as PWA
- [ ] All code follows established patterns and conventions
- [ ] Project structure supports scalable feature development

## Development Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure Node.js 18+ and pnpm are installed
2. **API Keys**: Create `.env.local` with required API keys (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
3. **Database**: Initialize SQLite database and run initial migrations
4. **Testing Strategy**: Follow TDD principles - write tests before implementation
5. **Code Quality**: All code must pass ESLint and Prettier checks
6. **Documentation**: Update CLAUDE.md with patterns and conventions established
7. **Modularity**: Design components and utilities for reusability and testability
8. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript strict mode for compile-time error prevention

## Success Metrics

- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- 100% test coverage for utility functions
- Sub-200ms development server start time
- Lighthouse PWA score > 90
- All linting rules pass
- Database operations complete under 10ms
- Bundle size under 500KB (gzipped)

This sprint establishes a solid foundation for rapid feature development in subsequent sprints while maintaining code quality, type safety, and developer experience excellence.
