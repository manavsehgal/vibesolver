# Sprint 003: Enhanced Architecture Canvas

## Overview

This sprint transforms VibeSolver's basic architecture visualization into a sophisticated infinite canvas interface inspired by Figma and Voiceflow. Users will experience a modern, interactive environment where they can view, edit, and manipulate AWS architecture diagrams with infinite zoom, pan, and drag-and-drop capabilities. The sprint delivers the core design vision of VibeSolver as a visual architecture editor while maintaining the existing solution generation capabilities and enhancing the user experience with advanced interaction patterns.

## Goals

- **Implement Infinite Canvas Interface** - Create a boundless workspace for architecture visualization with smooth zoom, pan, and navigation
- **Enable Interactive Component Manipulation** - Allow users to drag, resize, and reposition AWS service components with real-time updates
- **Enhance Visual Design System** - Implement modern UI patterns with improved component styling, animations, and visual feedback
- **Add Advanced Canvas Features** - Introduce minimap navigation, grid snapping, alignment helpers, and canvas state management
- **Deliver Professional User Experience** - Create a polished interface that rivals design tools like Figma and Miro for technical diagrams

## Tasks

- Integrate canvas state with existing solution database

### 8. Performance Optimizations

**Test Example**: Canvas maintains 60fps performance with 100+ components

- Implement viewport culling for efficient rendering of large diagrams
- Add component pooling and object reuse for memory management
- Create efficient hit-testing for component selection and interaction
- Implement canvas caching and dirty region tracking
- Add performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Optimize rendering pipeline for smooth animations

### 9. Mobile and Touch Support

**Test Example**: Canvas interface works smoothly on tablet devices with touch gestures

- Implement touch gesture support for zoom, pan, and selection
- Add responsive design for tablet and mobile viewports
- Create touch-optimized component manipulation controls
- Implement gesture recognition for multi-touch operations
- Add virtual keyboard support for component editing
- Create mobile-specific toolbar and navigation patterns

### 10. Advanced Visual Features

**Test Example**: Canvas provides professional design tool aesthetics and interactions

- Implement smooth animations for zoom, pan, and component operations
- Add visual feedback for hover states, selections, and interactions
- Create component shadows, depth, and visual hierarchy
- Implement canvas background patterns and customization options
- Add component connection indicators and relationship visualizations
- Create canvas themes and color scheme options
