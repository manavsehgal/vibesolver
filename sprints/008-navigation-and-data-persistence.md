# Sprint 008: Navigation and Data Persistence

## Overview

This sprint addresses critical gaps in VibeSolver's core functionality by implementing proper navigation, database persistence, and consistent user experience patterns. While Sprint 007 built the UI components for solution management, this sprint focuses on making them actually work by connecting the frontend to the database layer, fixing navigation workflows, and ensuring data persists across sessions. This sprint transforms VibeSolver from a prototype with mock data into a fully functional solution management platform.

## Goals

- **Implement Database Persistence** - Connect solution storage to SQLite database with full CRUD operations
- **Fix Navigation System** - Make header navigation buttons functional with proper routing and state management
- **Consistent Notification System** - Replace alerts with proper toast notifications throughout the application
- **Complete Solution Library Integration** - Ensure saved solutions appear in the library and can be loaded/managed
- **Implement Session Management** - Enable users to access their solutions across browser sessions

## Tasks

### 1. Database Integration and Persistence Layer

**Test Example**: Solutions saved to database persist after browser refresh and can be retrieved instantly

- Implement database connection and CRUD operations in `src/db/index.ts`
- Create solution persistence functions: `saveSolution`, `loadSolutions`, `updateSolution`, `deleteSolution`
- Add database initialization and migration handling for new users
- Implement proper error handling and validation for database operations
- Connect Zustand store actions to actual database operations instead of in-memory state
- Add database indexes for efficient querying of solutions by date, tags, and title
- Implement data integrity checks and foreign key constraints

### 2. Navigation System and Routing

**Test Example**: Header navigation buttons navigate to correct pages and maintain application state

- Implement functional navigation handlers in `Layout.tsx` header component
- Add routing logic to `App.tsx` for `/`, `/library`, `/history`, and `/help` paths
- Create proper navigation state management to handle page transitions
- Implement breadcrumb navigation for better user orientation
- Add keyboard navigation support (arrow keys, tab navigation)
- Create navigation history stack for back/forward functionality
- Ensure navigation state persists during component re-renders

### 3. Toast Notification System

**Test Example**: All user actions provide consistent feedback via toast notifications instead of browser alerts

- Replace `alert()` calls with proper toast notifications using existing `useToast` hook
- Implement success, error, warning, and info notification types
- Add notification queuing and auto-dismiss functionality
- Create notification persistence for critical messages
- Implement notification history and recall functionality
- Add notification customization options (position, duration, styling)
- Ensure notifications are accessible with proper ARIA labels

### 4. Solution Library Data Integration

**Test Example**: Solutions saved from the main interface immediately appear in the library with full metadata

- Connect `SolutionLibrary` component to database via store actions
- Implement proper loading states while fetching solutions from database
- Add error handling for database connection issues and data corruption
- Implement pagination for large solution collections
- Add real-time updates when solutions are modified in other components
- Create solution thumbnail generation and caching
- Implement solution metadata validation and schema enforcement

### 5. Session Management and State Persistence

**Test Example**: User preferences, view settings, and session data persist across browser restarts

- Implement session state persistence using localStorage
- Save user preferences (library view mode, filters, sort options) to local storage
- Add session restoration on application startup
- Implement proper cleanup of expired session data
- Create session analytics and usage tracking
- Add session conflict resolution for multiple tabs
- Implement session-based auto-save functionality

### 6. History and Activity Tracking

**Test Example**: Users can view their solution creation and modification history with timestamps

- Create history tracking system for user actions (create, modify, delete solutions)
- Implement activity feed showing recent solution interactions
- Add solution version history with diff visualization
- Create history search and filtering capabilities
- Implement history export functionality
- Add activity analytics and usage patterns
- Create history cleanup and archiving for performance

### 7. Help System and Documentation

**Test Example**: Help navigation opens comprehensive in-app documentation with searchable content

- Create in-app help system with searchable documentation
- Implement contextual help tooltips and guided tours
- Add keyboard shortcut reference and help overlay
- Create video tutorials and interactive guides
- Implement help search functionality with instant results
- Add user feedback and support ticket system
- Create help content version management

### 8. Solution Loading and Management

**Test Example**: Users can load previously saved solutions, edit them, and re-save with version tracking

- Implement solution loading functionality from library
- Add solution editing capabilities with change tracking
- Create solution duplication and template creation features
- Implement solution sharing and export from loaded solutions
- Add solution comparison between different versions
- Create solution merging and conflict resolution
- Implement solution archiving and restoration

### 9. Error Handling and Recovery

**Test Example**: Application gracefully handles database errors, network issues, and corrupt data

- Implement comprehensive error boundary components
- Add database error recovery and retry mechanisms
- Create data validation and corruption detection
- Implement automatic backup and recovery procedures
- Add error reporting and analytics
- Create user-friendly error messages and recovery options
- Implement offline mode with data synchronization

### 10. Performance Optimization and Caching

**Test Example**: Application loads instantly with cached data and provides smooth interactions

- Implement solution caching strategy for faster loading
- Add lazy loading for solution thumbnails and metadata
- Create database query optimization and indexing
- Implement virtual scrolling for large solution collections
- Add image and asset caching for architecture diagrams
- Create background data synchronization
- Implement performance monitoring and optimization alerts

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Solutions persist in SQLite database across browser sessions with data integrity
- [ ] Header navigation buttons route to correct pages and maintain application state
- [ ] All user actions provide feedback via consistent toast notifications
- [ ] Saved solutions immediately appear in library with accurate metadata and thumbnails
- [ ] Solution library loads efficiently with proper loading states and error handling
- [ ] Users can load, edit, and re-save solutions with full version tracking
- [ ] Application state (preferences, filters, view modes) persists across sessions
- [ ] Help system provides searchable documentation accessible via navigation
- [ ] History tracking shows all user activities with timestamps and context
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages database issues with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Performance remains optimal with response times under 500ms for all operations
- [ ] Data validation prevents corruption and ensures schema compliance

## Development Instructions

1. **Database-First Implementation**: Start with database layer and work up to UI components
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Implement core functionality first, then add advanced features
3. **Error Handling Priority**: Add comprehensive error handling at every data interaction point
4. **User Experience Focus**: Ensure every action provides immediate and clear feedback
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Track and optimize all database queries and data operations
6. **Data Integrity Emphasis**: Implement validation and constraints at all data access points
7. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests for all database operations and navigation flows
8. **Incremental Testing**: Test each feature independently before integration
