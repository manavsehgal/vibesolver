# Sprint 002: Core Solution Interface

## Overview

This sprint implements the core VibeSolver user interface that transforms the project from a basic scaffold into a functional AI-powered AWS Solutions Architect. Users can input natural language business requirements and receive comprehensive AWS solutions with visual architecture components. The sprint focuses on delivering an end-to-end feature slice that demonstrates the primary value proposition of VibeSolver while establishing the foundation for the infinite canvas design system.

## Goals

- **Implement Solution Generation Workflow** - Build complete UI flow from requirements input to solution display
- **Create Visual Architecture Display** - Develop component-based architecture visualization with drag capabilities  
- **Establish Design System Foundation** - Create reusable UI components following modern design principles
- **Integrate AI Service Layer** - Connect the frontend UI to the existing AI service functions
- **Deliver Functional MVP** - Enable users to generate and view AWS solutions through an intuitive interface

## Tasks

### 1. Core UI Components Library

**Test Example**: `npm run test` passes for all component unit tests

- Create base Button component with variants (primary, secondary, outline)
- Implement Input and Textarea components with validation states
- Build Card component for solution and service displays
- Create LoadingSpinner and ErrorBoundary components
- Implement Toast notification system for user feedback
- Add Modal component for detailed views and confirmations

### 2. Requirements Input Interface

**Test Example**: User can type requirements and trigger solution generation

- Build RequirementsForm component with multi-line text input
- Implement character count and input validation
- Add example prompts and suggestions for user guidance
- Create submit button with loading state integration
- Implement form state management with proper error handling
- Add keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter) for quick submission

### 3. Solution Display Components

**Test Example**: Generated solution data renders correctly in structured format

- Create SolutionCard component showing title, description, and cost
- Build AWSServiceList component displaying services with purposes
- Implement SolutionHeader with title, cost estimate, and actions
- Create RecommendationsList for displaying optimization suggestions
- Add solution metadata display (generation time, last modified)
- Implement solution sharing and export functionality

### 4. Architecture Visualization Foundation

**Test Example**: Architecture components render with correct positioning

- Build ArchitectureCanvas component using absolute positioning
- Create draggable ArchitectureComponent with service icons
- Implement ConnectionLine component for service relationships
- Add zoom and pan capabilities for canvas navigation
- Create component palette for adding new services
- Implement grid snapping and alignment helpers

### 5. Solution Generation Integration

**Test Example**: AI service calls complete successfully with proper error handling

- Connect RequirementsForm to useGenerateAWSSolution hook
- Implement loading states during AI processing
- Add error handling with user-friendly messages
- Create solution persistence to local database
- Implement solution history and recent solutions list
- Add retry mechanism for failed generations

### 6. Application Layout and Navigation

**Test Example**: Navigation works correctly between different views

- Create main application layout with header and sidebar
- Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Build navigation menu with solution history
- Add breadcrumb navigation for deep linking
- Create dashboard showing recent solutions and quick actions
- Implement proper routing structure for future features

### 7. Data Persistence Integration

**Test Example**: Solutions save to database and load correctly on refresh

- Connect solution display to database through stores
- Implement automatic saving of generated solutions
- Add solution update functionality for modifications
- Create solution deletion with confirmation
- Build solution search and filtering capabilities
- Implement data migration handling for schema updates

### 8. Performance Optimizations

**Test Example**: Application loads quickly and responds smoothly

- Implement React.memo for expensive components
- Add lazy loading for architecture visualization
- Optimize re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Implement debounced search and input handling
- Add virtual scrolling for large solution lists
- Create efficient state updates in Zustand stores

### 9. User Experience Enhancements

**Test Example**: Interface provides clear feedback for all user actions

- Add skeleton loading states for better perceived performance
- Implement progressive disclosure for complex information
- Create contextual help and tooltips for AWS services
- Add keyboard navigation support throughout the interface
- Implement undo/redo functionality for solution modifications
- Create onboarding flow for first-time users

### 10. Testing and Quality Assurance

**Test Example**: All components have comprehensive test coverage

- Write unit tests for all new React components
- Create integration tests for solution generation workflow
- Add accessibility tests with testing-library/jest-dom
- Implement visual regression testing for UI components
- Create mock data utilities for consistent testing
- Add performance testing for architecture visualization

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can input business requirements and generate AWS solutions
- [ ] Generated solutions display with title, description, services, and cost
- [ ] Architecture components render visually with proper positioning
- [ ] Solution data persists to local database correctly
- [ ] Error states provide clear feedback and recovery options
- [ ] Loading states indicate progress during AI processing
- [ ] Interface is responsive across desktop and mobile devices
- [ ] All new components have >80% test coverage
- [ ] Application follows accessibility best practices (WCAG 2.1)
- [ ] Solution generation completes within 30 seconds
- [ ] UI performance maintains 60fps during interactions
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds with zero errors

## Development Instructions

1. **Component-First Development**: Build reusable components before implementing specific features
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing component logic
3. **Incremental Integration**: Connect one AI service function at a time to frontend
4. **Mobile-First Responsive**: Design for mobile screens first, then scale up
5. **Accessibility Priority**: Include ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML
6. **Error-First Design**: Implement error states before success states
7. **Performance Monitoring**: Use React DevTools to profile component performance
8. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript strict mode for all component props and state

## Success Metrics

- User can complete requirements → solution generation → solution view workflow in <2 minutes
- AI solution generation success rate >95% with valid inputs
- Page load time <3 seconds on desktop, <5 seconds on mobile
- Solution display rendering <1 second after data fetch
- Zero accessibility violations in automated testing
- Component library covers 100% of design system needs
- Database operations complete in <100ms for solution CRUD
- User interface passes usability testing with 90% task completion rate

This sprint establishes VibeSolver as a functional AI-powered AWS Solutions Architect tool, providing users with immediate value while creating a solid foundation for advanced features like infinite canvas editing, flashcard generation, and what-if analysis in future sprints.
