# Sprint 006: Critical Bug Fixes and UX Improvements

## Overview

This sprint addresses critical functionality bugs and user experience issues that are preventing VibeSolver from delivering its core value proposition. The sprint focuses on fixing the completely broken flashcard generation system, resolving canvas interaction problems, and implementing essential UX improvements for the architecture visualization canvas. These fixes will restore core learning functionality and significantly improve the user experience for architecture diagram manipulation.

## Goals

- **Fix Critical Flashcard Generation Bug** - Resolve API schema validation errors preventing flashcard generation from working
- **Enhance Architecture Canvas Usability** - Implement square canvas layout, improved panning, and auto-redraw functionality
- **Improve User Interaction Patterns** - Fix keyboard controls, event handling, and visual feedback systems
- **Optimize Canvas Performance** - Implement efficient rendering and interaction handling for smoother user experience
- **Restore Learning Features** - Ensure all AI-powered learning features work reliably end-to-end

## Tasks

### 1. Fix Flashcard Generation Schema and API Integration

**Test Example**: Generate flashcards for AWS solution works without API errors and produces relevant study content

- Fix Zod schema configuration in `ai.ts` to use object wrapper instead of direct array schema
- Resolve "tools.0.custom.input_schema.type: Input should be 'object'" API validation error
- Correct the flashcard generation data flow between VibeSolver and FlashcardViewer components
- Implement proper error handling and validation for flashcard API responses
- Fix the FlashcardGenerator component logic to actually call AI service instead of returning empty arrays
- Add comprehensive error tracking and user feedback for flashcard generation failures
- Test flashcard generation end-to-end with real AWS solutions and validate response quality

### 2. Implement Square Architecture Canvas Layout

**Test Example**: Architecture canvas displays as perfect square maintaining aspect ratio across different screen sizes

- Change canvas height from `h-96` (384px) to match width for square aspect ratio
- Implement responsive canvas sizing that maintains square proportions on different devices
- Add CSS container queries for optimal canvas sizing across viewport dimensions
- Configure canvas layout to center content optimally in square format
- Test canvas responsiveness on mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes
- Ensure architecture components scale appropriately within square canvas boundaries
- Add visual indicators for canvas boundaries and optimal content area

### 3. Fix Canvas Panning and Interaction Issues

**Test Example**: Dragging empty canvas areas pans the view smoothly without interfering with component interactions

- Debug and fix mouse event handling for canvas panning when dragging empty areas
- Implement proper event propagation to distinguish between canvas panning and component dragging
- Fix canvas panning sensitivity and momentum for natural interaction feel
- Add touch gesture support for mobile canvas panning and zooming
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for canvas navigation (arrow keys, +/- for zoom)
- Fix edge cases where panning gets stuck or behaves unexpectedly
- Add visual feedback during panning operations (cursor changes, smooth transitions)

### 4. Implement Auto-Redraw and Layout Optimization

**Test Example**: Redraw button automatically arranges architecture components with minimal overlap and optimal visibility

- Add "Redraw" button to architecture canvas controls alongside zoom and fit controls
- Implement intelligent component layout algorithm to minimize overlap and maximize readability
- Create force-directed layout algorithm for automatic component positioning
- Add component collision detection and automatic spacing optimization
- Implement layout presets (grid, hierarchical, circular) for different architecture types
- Add animation transitions for smooth component repositioning during redraw
- Ensure redraw preserves logical relationships between connected components

### 5. Fix Keyboard Controls and Interaction Patterns

**Test Example**: Spacebar flips flashcards, arrow keys navigate cards, and all keyboard shortcuts work consistently

- Fix spacebar keydown event handling in FlashcardViewer to properly flip cards
- Implement consistent keyboard navigation across all components (arrow keys, enter, escape)
- Add keyboard shortcuts documentation and visual hints in UI
- Fix event bubbling issues preventing keyboard events from reaching correct handlers
- Implement focus management for accessibility and keyboard navigation flow
- Add keyboard shortcuts for canvas operations (pan with arrow keys, zoom with +/-)
- Test keyboard controls work consistently across different browsers and operating systems

### 6. Enhance Error Handling and User Feedback

**Test Example**: All error states provide clear user feedback and recovery options without breaking the application

- Implement comprehensive error boundaries for AI service failures and component crashes
- Add loading states and progress indicators for all async operations (flashcard generation, API calls)
- Create user-friendly error messages that explain what went wrong and how to recover
- Implement retry mechanisms for transient API failures and network issues
- Add toast notifications for successful operations and error states
- Implement graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable (show mock content)
- Add error logging and analytics to track and debug user-reported issues

### 7. Optimize Canvas Rendering and Performance

**Test Example**: Canvas interactions remain smooth with 50+ architecture components and complex diagrams

- Implement virtualization for large architecture diagrams with many components
- Add performance monitoring for canvas operations and interaction responsiveness
- Optimize component rendering to prevent unnecessary re-renders during interactions
- Implement efficient hit testing for component selection and interaction detection
- Add debouncing for expensive operations like layout recalculation and auto-fit
- Optimize canvas transform calculations for smooth zooming and panning
- Implement canvas caching strategies for improved render performance

### 8. Improve Visual Design and Accessibility

**Test Example**: Canvas and flashcard interfaces meet WCAG accessibility standards and provide excellent visual clarity

- Enhance visual contrast and readability for architecture components and text
- Implement proper focus indicators for keyboard navigation and screen readers
- Add ARIA labels and semantic markup for accessibility compliance
- Improve color schemes and visual hierarchy for better component distinction
- Add high contrast mode and accessibility preference support
- Implement consistent design patterns across all interaction states (hover, active, selected)
- Test interface usability with screen readers and accessibility tools

### 9. Add Comprehensive Testing Coverage

**Test Example**: All critical functionality has unit and integration tests preventing regression bugs

- Write unit tests for fixed AI service schema validation and API integration
- Add integration tests for flashcard generation end-to-end workflow
- Create tests for canvas interaction patterns (panning, zooming, component dragging)
- Implement visual regression tests for canvas layout and component positioning
- Add accessibility tests for keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- Create performance tests for canvas operations and large diagram handling
- Test error scenarios and edge cases to prevent future regressions

### 10. Documentation and User Guidance

**Test Example**: Users can quickly learn all canvas controls and flashcard features through clear in-app guidance

- Add in-app tooltips and help text for canvas controls and interaction patterns
- Create quick start guide for flashcard generation and study workflows
- Document keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features
- Add contextual help for error states and troubleshooting common issues
