## Overview

This sprint completes the solution management functionality by implementing the remaining roadmap items and polishing the user experience. The focus is on making solution persistence work across sessions, implementing functional Export/Share context menu actions, completing solution loading and editing workflows, removing the deprecated History feature, and resolving production server shutdown issues. This sprint transforms VibeSolver into a fully functional solution management platform with reliable data persistence and professional collaboration features.
