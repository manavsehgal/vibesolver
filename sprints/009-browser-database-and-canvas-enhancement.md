# Sprint 009: Browser Database Integration and Canvas Enhancement

## Overview

This sprint addresses the critical database compatibility issue blocking solution persistence and completes the architecture canvas feature set to deliver a fully functional VibeSolver platform. The sprint replaces the incompatible Node.js better-sqlite3 database layer with browser-compatible IndexedDB storage, implements advanced canvas interaction patterns, and enhances the diagram layout algorithms. This sprint transforms VibeSolver from a prototype with broken persistence into a production-ready solution management platform that works reliably in all browsers.

## Goals

- **Fix Critical Database Layer** - Replace better-sqlite3 with browser-compatible IndexedDB for reliable solution persistence
- **Complete Canvas Interaction System** - Implement smooth panning, intelligent redraw strategies, and advanced layout controls
- **Optimize Diagram Layout Algorithms** - Add multiple layout strategies, collision detection, and automatic optimization
- **Enhance User Experience** - Provide consistent performance across all browsers with responsive interactions
- **Deliver Production-Ready Platform** - Ensure all core features work reliably for end-to-end solution management workflows
