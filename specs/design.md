The VibeSolver web app should be designed with latest UI design system to provide a modern, reactive, easy, usable, and visual interface to achieve the intended requirements of the product. The design system and UI is inspired by Figma Infinite Canvas UI where user can design using drag and drop on an infinite canvas and Voiceflow Visual Workflow editor where user can visually connect steps of a workflow and run the workflows step by step (see attached images).
